# Postman

One of the easiest ways to begin exploring the Moltin API is using [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/). The [Postman collection](https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/f56bebbef7ecc72a6827) has full API coverage, and all you need to get started is your API keys.

### Setup

[![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/f56bebbef7ecc72a6827)

1. Configure the environment variable with your own `client_id` and `client_secret`. The collection uses multiple variables to be replaced with values or used with a configured environment. To learn more about environments, consult [Postman documentation](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/v6/postman/environments_and_globals/intro_to_environments_and_globals).
2. Generate an access token using the implicit or client\_credentials requests within the Authentication folder.
