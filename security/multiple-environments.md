# Multiple Environments

Projects created donâ€™t have a `test` or `production` mode. You may wish to create a project for development and staging to perform any modifications to your production store.

One of the benefits of a headless API is the ability to work locally in development mode but pull data from a real API, in this case it would be with your development project API keys.

If you are a developer and share your code with others, you may wish to invite users separately to each development or staging project. By doing this you can limit access to your production store to prevent any unwanted changes.
