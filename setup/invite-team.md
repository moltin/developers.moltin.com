# Invite Team

You can invite team members to join your project via the moltin [account dashboard](https://accounts.moltin.com/). Each team member will have full access to your project via the API and [dashboard](https://dashboard.com/).

Every team member has their own unique API `client_id` and `client_secret`. This is really helpful if you invite external developers to work on your project, you can easily revoke their access at anytime.
