# Payment

This page collates all content on integrating payment into your project. Click on a box to access the guide.

At the moment, Moltin supports the following third-party gateways:

* Stripe
* Adyen
* Braintree
* CardConnect

For all other integrations that are not yet officially supported, you can directly integrate with your payment gateway of choice and link this back to Moltin with the [**manual gateway**](implement-own-payment-gateway.md).
