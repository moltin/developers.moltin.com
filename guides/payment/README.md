This page collates all content on integrating payment into your project. Click on a box below to access the guide you wish to read.

At the moment, Moltin supports the following third-party payment gateways:

* [Stripe](payment-gateway-integration.md#make-a-payment)
* [Adyen](payment-gateway-integration.md#make-a-payment)
* [Braintree](payment-gateway-integration.md#make-a-payment)
* [CardConnect](payment-gateway-integration.md#make-a-payment)

For all other integrations that are not yet officially supported, you can directly integrate with your payment gateway of choice and link this back to Moltin with the [**manual gateway**](implement-own-payment-gateway.md).
