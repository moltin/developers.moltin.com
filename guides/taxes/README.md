# Taxes

Moltin allows you to apply tax items to a cart for every product added to that cart.

* **Apply a custom tax item** in a scenario in which you have your own tax calculation system configured, or if you want to apply a flat tax rate.

* **Integrate a third party tax calculator** in a scenario in which you need a tax calculation system. We use TaxJar as an example.
