# React + Shopkit

The Moltin [react-microsite](https://github.com/moltin-examples/react-microsite) example is built with React and uses [Shopkit](../developer-tools/shopkit.md) to display a product carousel, add to cart button, cart and checkout flow.

* [Demo](https://moltin-examples.github.io/react-microsite/#/)
* [Source Code](https://github.com/moltin-examples/react-microsite)

Using the [Now CLI](https://zeit.co/now) you can deploy directly from GitHub. You'll need your Moltin `client_id` to successfully deploy.

```bash
npm i -g now # unless installed already
now moltin-examples/react-microsite -e MOLTIN_CLIENT_ID=x
```
