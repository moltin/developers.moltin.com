# Getting Started

Getting Started walks you through a basic project configuration \([**Setup**](https://developers.moltin.com/getting-started/setup)\), and lists some typical steps to consider before you launch your project \([**Launch Checklist**](https://developers.moltin.com/getting-started/launch-checklist)\).

In the nutshell, to get yourself up and running in 5 simple steps:

1. Sign up as a Moltin user to get access to Moltin account and dashboard.
2. Set up a Moltin project.
3. Optionally, invite your colleagues to collaborate. 
4. Get the Moltin API Keys.
5. Start making your first API requests.
