# Launch Checklist

Below are a few things to consider before launching an online store, mobile app or IoT integration. Depending on the type of project you're launching, your checklist may look a little different.

Consider these as helpful reminders. ðŸ˜‰

**Added a payment gateway** While we provide three out of the box payment gateways, you may wish to integrate your own payment gateway via the manual gateway option. Before you launch a store that accepts payments, you will need to have an active payment method.

**Set a default currency** By default we assign `USD` as the default currency when you create a new project. You may wish to add or update this currency with your preferred options.

**Set product prices** Make sure to set a price for your products you have set as `live`. This will prevent any mistakes when selling items for free when they should be paid. You can also set products as `draft` that you don't want to sell immediately.

**Export optimised images** You will want to modify the images you deliver to be optimised for mobile. This will reduce the time it takes your visitors to browse pages of your app.
